"""
Return sends a specified value back to its caller whereas Yield 
can produce a sequence of values. We should use yield when we 
want to iterate over a sequence, but donâ€™t want to store the 
entire sequence in memory.

Yield are used in Python generators. A generator function is 
defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to 
generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather 
than return. If the body of a def contains yield, the function 
automatically becomes a generator function.
